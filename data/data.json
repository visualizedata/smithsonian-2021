      "description": "The National Museum of African American History and Culture’s mission is “to promote and highlight the contributions of African Americans”. Its diverse array of artifacts come from a long history of both triumphs and injustices. If one were to analyze a collection of one object type (instruments, clothing, etc.) from this museum, could that collection alone tell a story of racial justice?During the 19th century, the abolitionist movement in America coincided with the advancements of photography technology. This resulted in recently-freed African Americans having easier access to cameras and gaining control of self-representation in a fight against racist stereotypes. African Americans could finally present and immortalize their best selves.This project explored the titles of the photography collection through an interactive word tree. Once users click to the end of a title structure, the corresponding photograph is revealed. This visualization offers a poetic approach to exploring the NMAAHC’s photography collection that leads users to other thematic analyses of the collection. What can we learn from the juxtaposition of the Smithsonian’s title structure versus the intention of the photo? How did the relationship between the photographer/photographed evolve? Is there further analysis to explore from the photos of the “unidentified”?",

      "description":"This project is a journey through the original watercolor and gouache design drawings by the legendary and prolific textile designer Suzie Zuzek (1920 - 2011). Between 1962 and 1985, Zuzek created over 1,500 designs for Key West Hand Print Fabrics in Key West, Florida, which were used by Lilly Pulitzer. Via the amazing collections from the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum. We aim to showcase the common motifs and style evolutions. To bridge between fabrics and fashion, we create an interface to both showcase the textile design as a full size wallpaper to create an immersive experience as well as creating hand-drawn fashion figures that give the audience a sense of how these fabrics feel like on the fashion design. To disentangle the effect ofSuzie Zuzek’s fabrics on the fashion vs. the Lilly Pulitzer fashion style itself, we drew these fashion figures from scratch and varied the styles significantly from the original Lilly Pulitzer brand. We hope the study reveals the nature and scope of Zuzek's artistic contribution to the iconic Pulitzer style.",

When sketching and designing this project I was curious to discover who exactly made it into the National Portrait Gallery, what they may have accomplished, and if there were demographic similarities across the individuals in the collection. In particular, I hoped to potentially highlight notable individuals or any disparities in the collection while also giving users the ability to view the gallery and portraits themselves. Drawing inspiration from the piece “A Sort of Joy” I added a layer of abstraction to my project by particularly focusing on the first names of the individuals in the collection and the number of times they may appear. In a future iteration of this project I hope to add gender identity as an element with which users can interact when they explore the gallery. ",

Buttons, posters, pamphlets, fliers, and more have been used throughout history to disseminate persuasive ideas and contribute to change in society. Different decades brought different popularity to the types of ephemera that were utilized. Were fliers popular during the 60s and 70s because of their ease of distribution? Were placards more prominent in recent years because of the global marches that flooded the streets during the black lives matter protests? A few prominent movements in history are represented in this Smithsonian dataset, and after clicking the arrow to reveal the second visualization we can see how each movement is represented by the ephemera that helped shape them. Temporary, tangible objects that were once used as persuasive media become timeless, priceless memorabilia decades after they’ve left their mark.",

Back then, the boxer was popularly nicknamed “The Greatest,” which his wife then turned into G.O.A.T. (Greatest OF All Time) for publicity in the 1990s. In addition to being cited as the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time, other seminal developments took place outside the boxing ring. By crafting a dynamic biography of the boxer Muhammad Ali, this project weaves together different elements of his legacy to help the reader explore either horizontally or vertically the different facets of Muhammad Ali’s life. In addition to textual content, images of symbolic objects displayed at the Smithsonian as well as iconic pictures help to enhance the storytelling experience. Finally, this project juxtaposes his record-breaking boxing accomplishments with the significant social and political developments that characterized his era, without forgetting to include noteworthy artistic creations that were influenced by performances as well as by his sense of social justice. This interactive project blends data-driven visual representations (derived from his boxing accomplishments) with more cultural elements such as posters, archival photos or symbolic artefacts, and allows readers to read more about the different chapters of his life (for example by examining more closely iconic images or by clicking on a given period of interest). Almost all images were obtained through the Smithsonian Open Access API, narratives and boxing data were obtained through literature review.",
